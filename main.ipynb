It's essential to further quantify the costs and assess whether they can be absorbed within the current budget.\n",

      "• **Business cycles**: The upgrade requires approximately 45 minutes of training for the IT team to update Jamf Pro software, which may be manageable during Q1 or Q3, peak seasons for the organization. However, the maintenance windows are primarily during Q4, which could be a constraint.\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Quality improvements**: The upgrade is expected to improve hardware resource utilization, reduce software bugs and errors, and support the organization's goal of \"Improve developer productivity.\" This quality improvement is particularly relevant for a medium-sized organization with a large development team (100 members).\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Risk tolerance and compliance requirements**: Despite some minor risks to hardware, software, and web applications, the upgrade is likely to be within the organization's low-risk tolerance. Compliance with security and policy requirements can be ensured through the upgrade, which supports their compliance requirements for SOC2 and ISO27001.\n",

      "• **Team and workflow impact**: The upgrade will primarily affect the IT Operations, Development, and support teams, with some training required for the IT team and potential adjustments to workflows for end-users. The potential disruption to workflows should be weighed against the expected quality improvements.\n",
